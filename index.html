<p>The news about Google Glass just keeps coming today. After announcing that Glass is about to ship and releasing the Glass Mirror API documentation, Google has now also posted the full spec sheet for the Glass hardware. There are no major surprises here, but it’s nice to finally get to see what those users who will be able to buy the Explorer editions will get for their $1,500.</p>

<p>[&#8230;] It’s called ADP, and it’s a $10 billion (fiscal 2011 sales) outfit that processes the paychecks received last year by some 33 million people around the world — and which processed some $1.2 trillion in payments to workers in the U.S. And it does almost all of it in the cloud.

<p>The US publishing industry appears to be turning over a new leaf: ebook sales made up 22.5 percent of the industry&#8217;s net revenue last year, according to a new survey from the Association of American Publishers. That&#8217;s up from just 0.05 percent 10 years prior, when the AAP first began keeping track of ebook sales, and up from 16.98 percent in 2011. The categories that saw the biggest increase in ebook revenues included adult fiction, adult nonfiction, and religious books. Even more encouraging, the overall net revenue for the US publishing industry was $7.1 billion, up 6.2 percent from 2011. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>CloudApp has a pretty nice user experience. If you want to upload a file, all you have to do is drag it to the cloud icon on your taskbar and it&#8217;s automatically uploaded—and copied to your clipboard. It&#8217;s simple and gratifying to use, but I wanted a little more control and to avoid paying. I built something similar that uses Amazon&#8217;s Simple Storage Service (S3) as storage and a Python script in Mac OS X Automator. Here&#8217;s how to do it. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>This is an exciting puzzle. 

Just check out part of the answer:

</p><blockquote>It&#8217;s a time zone change on December 31st in Shanghai. See this page for details of 1927 in Shanghai. Basically at midnight at the end of 1927, the clocks went back 5 minutes and 52 seconds. So &#8220;1927-12-31&#160;23:54:08&#8221; actually happened twice, and it looks like Java is parsing it as the later possible instant for that local date/time - hence the difference. Just another episode in the often weird and wonderful world of time zones.</blockquote>

<p><blockquote>Goldberg leaves work at 5:30 PM every day to spend time with his family. While he does get back online after he puts his children to bed after 8:00 PM, he sets an example that makes it easier for the company to build and maintain its workforce. A CEO who spends time with his family every day demonstrates to other employees who have families that it’s okay to be home for dinner and live a life outside the office. All too often leadership teams say “work-life balance” is important and it’s okay to be home with your family for dinner – but they in fact do just the opposite. If you, as a CEO, want to shape the culture and build a workplace with a diverse team, you need to prove it with your actions. </blockquote></p>

<p>Shodan searchers have found control systems for a water park, a gas station, a hotel wine cooler and a crematorium. Cybersecurity researchers have even located command and control systems for nuclear power plants and a particle-accelerating cyclotron by using Shodan. [&#8230;]</p>
